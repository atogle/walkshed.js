# walkshed.js

walkshed.js is a prototype that demonstrates how raster analysis can be used to measure pedestrian access in a city. It relies on HTML5 canvas, utilizes [mapalgebra.js](https://github.com/atogle/mapalgebra.js), [globalmaptiles.js](https://github.com/atogle/globalmaptiles.js), and [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet), and uses [Mapbox Studio](http://mapbox.com/) to generate the data tiles.
