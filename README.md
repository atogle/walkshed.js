# walkshed.js

walkshed.js is a prototype that demonstrates how raster analysis can be used to measure pedestrian access in a city. It relies on HTML5 canvas, utilizes [costdistance.js](https://github.com/atogle/costdistance.js), [tile-stitcher.js](https://github.com/atogle/tile-stitcher.js), and [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/CloudMade/Leaflet), and uses [TileMill](http://mapbox.com/tilemill/) to generate the data tiles.
